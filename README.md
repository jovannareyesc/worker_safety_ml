# WORKER SAFETY: Machine Learning For Real-Time Worker Protection
The American Dream shines like no other in the world.
It dazzles those who come from utter darkness—wars, corrupt regimes, and collapsed economies.

But how much darkness must one endure under this dream?

Millions of immigrants arrive in the United States seeking safety, growth, and the ability to provide for their families. But what they often find instead is a harsh reality:

1. No dignified access to healthcares
2. Sky-high living costs
3. Cultural, linguistic, and even psychological alienation
4. And worst of all—exposure to violent crime, especially in the minimum-

While national crime rates may be declining, violence is concentrating in specific areas—the very ones where immigrant, low-skill workers are sent. Many work in extreme heat, unsafe environments, or crime-ridden urban zones just to survive or live paycheck to paycheck.

## Mission
My project aims to use machine learning to detect early signs of unsafe and threatening activity. Particularly in small businesses, convenience stores, and gas stations that are heavily staffed by underprotected immigrant workers.

Law enforcement agents can’t respond fast enough.
So what if we could detect threats before they escalate?

## Tasks To Undertake
-> Analyze real-time security footage using ML and computer vision

-> Detect patterns of suspicious group behavior (e.g., mob formations, fast clustering)

-> Trigger silent alerts for store clerks and owners

-> Create a low-cost, scalable solution for real-world, real-risk environments

### P.S.
This is an early-stage passion project being developed as I learn and grow in the field of machine learning.

Together, we can use tech not just to innovate, but to protect.
